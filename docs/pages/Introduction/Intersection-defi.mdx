# Intersection of AI and DeFi

DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is a new and exciting area of the blockchain industry that is transforming the traditional financial system. It allows for peer-to-peer lending, borrowing, and trading of digital assets without the need for intermediaries like banks.

AI is an innovative technology that is revolutionizing the way we interact with the world. With the introduction of AMM, the DeFi market has experienced even greater growth than before. However, this growth also brings complexities, challenges, and new opportunities, such as improving user experience.

How can DeFi users better interact with protocols? How can we manage assets across multiple chains? Can we easily spot opportunities? Just as vAMM transformed DEX trading, AI will help make DeFi more accessible to anyone and solve problems while creating more wealth.

We want to simplify things by introducing an Artificial Intelligence-driven DeFi protocol that enables anyone to exploit the advantages both offer. In doing so, we have created the AI x DeFi product that empowers anyone to instruct-DeFi

During the early days of computers, they were operated by typing in commands to run
programs. However, as they evolved, graphic user interfaces emerged, making it easier
and simpler for not just techies but for everyone to use computers. The use of computers
has continued to evolve.

Similarly, in finance, we have seen the evolution from one form of currency to another and now to cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a revolutionary application of blockchain technology in finance that enables the transfer of value across far distances at a fraction of what it previously cost.

Cryptocurrency is unlocking new ways to send, receive, and store value. While cryptocurrency trading has become increasingly popular in recent years, it can be a daunting task, especially for those who are new to the world of digital currencies. The user experience with cryptocurrency is complex for new entrants - setting up a wallet, storing crypto assets (Fungible Tokens & NFTs), interacting with protocols, trading, saving, lending, borrowing, etc.

To address this challenge, we have developed the ChatXBT protocol, your AI-powered companion that makes cryptocurrency trading, storing, and using accessible and easier for everyone.

In this whitepaper, we will explore the benefits of ChatXBT, its application in the intersection of AI and DeFI

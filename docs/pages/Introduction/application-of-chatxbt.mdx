## `DeFi Lending`

ChatXBT can be used to access and interact with DeFi lending protocols that offer users decentralized borrowing and lending services. What this means is that you can chat-lend or chat-borrow.

`Lend $ETH-1 on Aave`

`Borrow $ETH-1 on Compound`

## `Crypto Trading`

With ChatXBT, users can access their cryptocurrency exchange accounts from their mobile devices or computers and make trades in real-time across DEXs on several chains. ChatXBT improves user experience by enabling traders to chat-trade. For example:

`Use 1000 USDT to buy $ETH if price is  $1520 on Uniswap`

`Sell the ETH I just bought for  10% profit on 1inch`

What this does is to buy one ETH at the said price and sell it all when the price reaches to 10%. Alternatively, we can loc in the 10% profit and instruct it to readjust. Whenever the price goes up, it locks in the profit and sells at a defined price. \

## `Savings Products:`

ChatXBT can help users manage their savings by offering access to various DeFi savings protocols that offer higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts. For example, a trader could chat-save with this on Aave.

`Save ETH-1 on Aave`

## `NFT-FI`

ChatXBT can help users navigate the rapidly growing area of NFT-FI, where non-fungible tokens are used as collateral in decentralized lending and borrowing protocols.

Buying at a defined price

`Buy CryptoPunk0001 for  2,000,000 usdt  on Sudo`

Buying at market price

`Buy cryptoPunk0001 on Sudo`

You can sell by using the Sell command instead of the Buy.

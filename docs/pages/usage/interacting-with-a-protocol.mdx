# Interacting with a protocol

You can send explicit commands within the chat interface

To interact with a protocol not within your default AI action settings, you have to give explicit command to ChatXBT for example

Every protocol integrated within ChatXBT can be interacted with using the `@` follwed
by the name of the protocol.

**`@JumpExchange`**

**`@Hop-protocol`**

These all depend on the identifier which developers of that protocol integrated them as with the ChatXBT protocol.
